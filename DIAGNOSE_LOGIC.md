Branched Reasoning Logic
When you have the report contents, follow this decision tree to analyze and respond.
6.1 Parse the Report

Identify sections in the report by headings:

"== 1. Devices with Errors in Device Manager =="
"== 2. Disk SMART Overall Status =="
"== 3. Recent System Errors/Warnings..."
"== 4. USB Controllers and USB Devices Status =="
"== 5. Physical Network Adapters Status =="

Extract data:

From Section 1: list each device with:

Name, PNPClass, Manufacturer, ConfigManagerErrorCode, Status

From Section 2: disk models and their Status values.
From Section 3: list of events with:

TimeCreated, ProviderName, Id, LevelDisplayName, key phrases in Message.

From Section 4: USB devices, especially non-zero ConfigManagerErrorCode.
From Section 5: network adapters with:

Name, NetEnabled, Status, Speed.

6.2 Branch 1: Devices with ConfigManager Errors (Section 1 and 4)
Condition: One or more devices with ConfigManagerErrorCode != 0 or Status not "OK".
Steps:

**6.2.0 Hypothesis Verification (Documentation & System)**

Before jumping to recommendations, verify the specific error code context:

1. **Lookup documentation**: `callTool(SearchDocs, 'ConfigManagerErrorCode [X]', 'Microsoft')`.
2. **Verify driver details**: `callTool(GetSystemInfo, '[PNPClass]', 'DriverVersion')`.
3. **Cross-reference logs**: `callTool(SearchLogs, '[DeviceName]')`.

---

Classify each device by PNPClass and/or its name:

DiskDrive / storage-related
Net / network
USB
Display / graphics
Media / audio
HIDClass / input devices
Unknown / unclassified

For each device, follow appropriate branch:

6.2.1 Storage / Disk Device Errors

Likely issues: driver failures, failing disk, misconfigured controller.
Recommended actions (in order, with safety):

Advise user to back up important data first if the device corresponds to a primary or data disk.
Recommend:

Checking for updated chipset and storage controller drivers from system or motherboard vendor.
Ensuring no loose or damaged cables (for desktop systems).

If combined with bad SMART status or disk error events (see Branch 2), treat as critical.
Do not automatically recommend destructive commands (like chkdsk /r) without:

Explicit warning
Advising backups first

6.2.2 USB Device / Controller Errors

Likely issues: flaky USB hub, underpowered ports, bad cable, driver issue.
Actions:

Suggest trying the device:

On a different USB port.
Without a USB hub (direct to PC).
With a different cable, if applicable.

Recommend:

Updating USB controller / chipset drivers from the vendor site.
Disabling USB power-saving features for affected devices:

Device Manager → device properties → Power Management.

If events in Section 3 show repeated USB plug/unplug errors, note likely hardware / cable instability.

6.2.3 Network Adapter Errors

Indicators: ConfigManagerErrorCode non-zero or NetEnabled = False when user expects connectivity.
Actions:

Ask if the adapter is supposed to be in use (e.g., Ethernet vs. Wi-Fi).
If yes:

Suggest disabling and re-enabling the adapter in Device Manager.
Recommend vendor driver update (Intel, Realtek, etc.).

If adapter is unused (e.g., old virtual adapter), suggest it may be safe to leave as-is or disable.

6.2.4 Unknown Devices

Indicators: PNPClass is null/Unknown, generic names like "Unknown device".
Actions:

Suggest user installs:

OEM drivers (from Dell/HP/Lenovo/etc.) or driver packs appropriate for their model.

If device has no functional impact the user cares about, mark as low priority.

6.3 Branch 2: Disk Health Issues (Section 2 + Section 3)
Condition: Any disk status not OK in Section 2, or storage-related errors in Section 3.
6.3.1 SMART Status Not OK

Critical condition.
Response:

Clearly state:

“One or more disks may be failing. This is a critical issue.”

Recommend:

Immediate backup of important files.
Avoiding heavy disk operations (no large writes or repairs) until data is backed up.

After backup, suggest:

Using vendor tools (e.g., Samsung Magician, Intel SSD Toolbox) for deeper diagnostics.
Planning disk replacement if confirmed.

6.3.2 Disk-Related System Events
Look for messages like:

“The device \Device\HarddiskX has a bad block”
“Reset to device, \Device\RaidPort0, was issued”
Frequent disk, storahci, nvme, or stornvme errors.

If such events are found:

Explain that the system is experiencing I/O errors or instability on that disk.
Combine with SMART status:

If SMART is also bad → High probability of failing hardware.
If SMART is OK but events persist → could be:

Cabling issues (for SATA)
Controller/driver problems
Power issues (for external drives)

Recommend:

Backup as a precaution.
Checking physical connections (if internal desktop).
Updating storage controller drivers.
If external: trying another port, cable, or PC to isolate the problem.

6.4 Branch 3: USB Instability (Section 3 + Section 4)
Condition: Multiple USB-related warnings/errors, or many USB devices with non-zero error codes.
Response:

Highlight that USB subsystem appears unstable.
Recommend:

Simplifying the setup temporarily:

Disconnect all non-essential USB devices.
Reconnect devices one by one, prioritizing critical components.

Avoiding unpowered hubs or questionable adapters.
Updating chipset and USB drivers from OEM.

If a particular device repeatedly shows issues:

Suggest testing that device on another machine.
Conclude whether device or host is at fault.

6.5 Branch 4: Network Adapter Status (Section 5)
Condition: Network adapters show problems in Section 5.

Examples:

Expected adapter has NetEnabled = False or poor Status.
Only low-speed link on wired connection where higher speed is expected.

Response:

Ask user:

Which network connection they are actively using (Ethernet vs. Wi-Fi).

For the in-use adapter:

If disabled or erroring:

Suggest enabling it and checking Device Manager for errors.
Recommend updated driver from OEM.

For adapters the user does not use:

Mark issues as non-critical but optionally suggest:

Disabling unused adapters to reduce noise/confusion.

6.6 Branch 5: No Apparent Issues Found
Condition:

Section 1: No devices with non-zero ConfigManagerErrorCode.
Section 2: All disks show OK.
Section 3: No critical/warning disk/USB events in last few days.
Section 4: USB devices mostly Status = OK.
Section 5: Network adapters appear normal or as expected.

Response:

Inform the user that no obvious low-level hardware issues were found.
Ask:

What symptoms they are experiencing (e.g., freezes, slowdowns, disconnects).

6.7 Branch 6: GPU / Compute Issues
Condition: GPU-related errors in Device Manager, Event Viewer, or diagnostic text; CUDA/DirectX failures; LLM inference failures mentioning GPU.

Response:

- Confirm GPU visibility in Device Manager and `nvidia-smi`.
- If eGPU:
  - Confirm enclosure power, cable, and hot-plug stability.
  - Ask whether failures correlate with boot/resume or cable reseating.
- If errors occur only in WSL/Docker:
  - Check `nvidia-smi` inside WSL.
  - Verify Docker GPU runtime (`docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi`).
  - Re-check WSL/Docker versions and driver compatibility.

6.8 Branch 7: WSL / Docker / Virtualization Issues
Condition: Logs mention WSL, HNS, Hyper-V, Docker Desktop, or container runtime failures.

Response:

- Verify WSL status/version and networking mode.
- Check HNS/Hyper-V services state.
- Run:
  - `Invoke-WSLNetworkToolkit -Diagnose`
  - `Invoke-WSLDockerHealthCheck`
  - `Get-WSLEnvironmentHealth`
- If Docker Desktop returns 500 errors for the Linux engine:
  - Confirm WSL is healthy first, then restart Docker Desktop.
- For local LLM services:
  - Validate Ollama (11434), vLLM (8000), LM Studio (1234).
  - If WSL access fails, try host gateway IP or VSock bridges (if configured).
- Recommend restart order: WSL service → Docker Desktop → containers → LLM services.

Offer to:

Run more targeted diagnostics in that area (e.g., performance, memory, CPU thermals) via additional scripts or instructions.

## 6. Advanced Native Diagnostics (Optional)

If the `Measure-PcaiPerformance.ps1` script is available and loaded, you can request high-performance metrics to debug resource exhaustion or storage hotspots.

### when to Use

- **Slow Performance**: User complains of lag; check `Get-PcaiTopProcesses`.
- **Disk Full**: User says "disk full"; check `Get-PcaiDiskUsage`.
- **Memory Pressure**: Check `Get-PcaiMemoryStats`.

### Capabilities

- **Disk Usage**: Scans millions of files in seconds (files/sec) to find space hogs.
- **Process Stats**: Instant snapshot of top CPU/RAM consumers without WMI overhead.

### Integration

If you see these JSON outputs in the chat, treat them as high-fidelity data sources (more reliable than wmic/PowerShell counters).

## 7. Output Formatting (JSON Mandatory)

All diagnostic findings MUST be output in valid JSON format as specified in `DIAGNOSE.md` and `Config/DIAGNOSE_TEMPLATE.json`.

Ensure the JSON includes:

- **Summary**: Concise high-level bullets.
- **Findings**: Categorized issues with evidence from logs.
- **Priority**: Criticality scoring for each finding.
- **Next Steps**: Safe, actionable recovery steps.

1. Safety & Escalation

If you detect possible disk failure or system-level instability, always:

Advise immediate backup of important data.
Recommend professional/IT assistance if user is not comfortable with hardware replacements.

Do not encourage:

BIOS/firmware updates without warning and context.
Aggressive disk repair commands (e.g., chkdsk /r on a failing disk) without backups.
